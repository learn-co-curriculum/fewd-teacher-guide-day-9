## Objectives

* Students will gain a deeper understanding of HTML and the DOM structure as well as get their first introduction to JavaScript

### Key Student Take-Aways

* Students should have an understanding of how browsers read and render HTML files
* Students should be able to access and alter content on a page via DOM manipulation

### Teacher Note

Students should know that if they’re using query selectors in console, they’re already using JavaScript! If students complete the lessons early, have them practice different ways to access and alter DOM content. They should practice getting elements by id, class, tag, etc.. they should also explore changing styling.

### Caveats

* Depending on the level of prior student experience, some students may already have exposure to JavaScript fundamentals.  For them, these lessons should be an opportunity to fill any gaps and strengthen their knowledge through review.  
* If there are students who complete the work in this class quickly, give them more complex DOM manipulation challenges - for instance, can they write a reusable code that retrieves all image sources from a webpage? Or, more advanced, have them go to sco.wikipedia.org - can they write a way to convert Scottish Wikipedia content into standard English?
